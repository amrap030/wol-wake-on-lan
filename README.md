# WOL - Wake on Lan

This is a minimal Wake-on-Lan (WoL) server to spin up your homeserver from anywhere in the world. It aims to provide reasonable security, since the application is probably internet-facing. Therefore, every server is protected with a password as well as a second factor, which is a totp one-time passcode with [Speakeasy](https://github.com/speakeasyjs/speakeasy).
